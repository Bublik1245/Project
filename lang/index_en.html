The formation of springs can be caused by various factors, such as an intersection of aquifers with negative forms of modern relief, geological and structural features of the area.</div>

                    <div class="b_text2">There’s a spring with holy or healing water near the village of Sherestin. Many people from other villages visit this  holy spring.According to the legend, people have found the image of the Great Martyr there. With solemn singing it was taken to the Church of the Nativity of the Most Holy Theotokos. But marvelous are Thy works, O Lord! The image was found again in the same place in the morning near the source. And again, with tears and prayer, it was taken to the church. But the Lord for the third time, by his invisible command, puts the image of the Great Martyr in its original place. And then a chapel was built here over the source, and the marvelous image of Paraskeva-Pyatnitsa was put in it. According to the memories of old people, the chapel was made of wood, there were 2 windows with gorgeous shutters. It stood on the spring until 1935-36, and then it was dismantled and transported to the place where the stud farm was, and a “bread shop” was set up in it. To this day the image of the Great Martyr stands near the spring, and clear cold healing water flows from it.</div>

Nowadays the territory is occupied by garden plots, and the area is called after the railway station – Klenki. Slightly upstream of the Sozh, on the site of the garden plots of Borovoe, there was a factory built in 1815 to supply bricks for the construction of the Peter and Paul Cathedral. The documents even preserved the name of the first worker - the peasant of Spasovoy Sloboda Trifon (Trofim) Ivanovich Kozhemyakin.</div>

of Dobritsa</div></pre>
                    <div class="b_text2">The spring is situated in the republican landscape reserve “Mozur ravines” By July 2018 the spring was landscaped within the framework of the action "Let's revive the springs of the Gomel region!" July 9, 2018 priest Gennady Nesterenya consecrated the Dobritsa spring in honor of the holy blessed Matrona of Moscow. To an old concrete staircase marked "July 1973" railings are installed. Replaced reinforced concrete ring. Water is discharged through a pipe, and a roof is arranged above the ring. Unfortunately, the approach was unsuccessful and it is difficult to draw water from the pipe without getting your feet wet. In my opinion, before the improvement of 2018, the spring looked more beautiful and epic. The spring is chained in a reinforced concrete ring. There are powerful keys in the bottom. Water overflows through the ring and forms a stream that flows into the Pripyat River. Cloth scraps hang on the trees around the spring, and there are coins on the bottom of the spring . The spring is very religious, although according to a local resident, another spring was previously revered as a saint, which was located 50m north, on the same road. During the years of Soviet power it was filled up.</div>
